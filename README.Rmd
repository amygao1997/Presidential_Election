## Instructions
1. Download data 
    - Edwood - committe master file 
    - Amy- candidate master file 
    - Emily - Candidate Committee Linkage File 
    - Olivia - Contribution to Candidates File 
 2. Copy over the pgAdmin code (Template) into SQL script 
 3. Edit the code to create a new table
 5. Name the file "Import.sql"
 4. Run the script at the command line using `psql`
    - Repeat until you get it right
 6. Upload the file to GitHub (we are all working on this together)

Naming Conventions:
1. mast = master
2. cand = candidate 
3. cmte = committee

##  How to add the `psql` binary to path

1. To find where the `psql` binary, use this code chunk to search within your application library (where the `psql` binary is):

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
find /Library -name "psql"
```

2. Copy the path that identfies the binary. To permanently be able to access `psql` via terminal, you need to edit your `.bash_profile` file. To do this do:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
nano ~/.bash_profile
```

Once you're in, paste your path into the file.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
#psql library path
export PATH=/Library/PostgreSQL/11/bin:$PATH
```

3. Now `echo` your path to make sure you made the correct changes: `echo $PATH`

4. Type in `psql -U postgres` into the command line. This logs you into `psql` as the user `postgres`. When asked for the password, enter the super user password you created when installing `postgres`. Not your computer's password. 

# How to create the database in PgAdmin

1. Right click `localhost` in the right side panel.
2. Click Create > Database...
3. In the window, give the database a name and click save.

# How to create the table with your SQL script via psql (ignore these steps for now)

1. Navigate to where your SQL script lives.

2. Next log in as user `postgres` and point your database to the path of the script.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
psql -U postgres [Insert your database name] < [Insert your SQL script name here]
```

For example, 
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
psql -U postgres Presidential_Election < import_candidate_master.sql
```

3. If it runs, congratulations ðŸŽ‰ if not, interpret the error message, fix the script, and go back to Step 2. 

# Creating a symbolic link

1.Indicate the absolute path to the directory you want to shortcut into and create a symbolic link with following code: 

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
ln -s /Users/mm17682/Documents/Presidential_Election/data /tmp/data
```

For example, 

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
ln -s /[insert target folder name] /[symbolic link path NOTE: also serves as shortcut name]
```

2. Check to see if the link was made correctly
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
ls -l /tmp
```

3. Now test it!
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
cd /tmp/data
```

Next do `ls`. If you don't see the contents of the directory that shortcutted into using the link, you didn't do it correctly. 

# Importing your data into the database you created in pgAdmin

1. After you've populated the script with the definitions, add the following \COPY command to the end of the script: 

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
\COPY candidate_master_info FROM '/tmp/data/cn.txt'
```

For example,

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
\COPY [insert your table name from PgAdmin] FROM [insert your symbolic path with your file name at the end]
```

# Running the script

1. Log into psql as user postgres via terminal.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
psql -U postgres 
```

2. Connect to the database you created with `\c Presidential_Election`.

For example, 
`\c [database name]`

3. Then import your SQL script using:
`\i import_candidate_master.sql`

4. If the terminal does not say `CREATE TABLE`, interpret the error and try again. 

# Remove duplicates

Show the lines three above and below the offending line with line numbers. Note the line number. Then delete the duplicate line. 

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
grep -n --context=3 "H8GA04117" cn.txt 
sed -i '1840d' cn.txt
```
